  "principles": [
    "Heavy work is only productive if clean; if bar speed slows, pivot to volume.",
    "No grinding reps (RPE 10 is rarely the goal).",
    "Deadlifts: Start every rep from the floor (dead stop).",
    "Warmups: Longer warmups preferred for confidence.",
    "Sick/Low Readiness: Immediately shift to volume work, do not force heavy weights."
  ],
  "physical_context": [
    "Supplements: Creatine 5g/day (started 2026-01-10).",
    "Knee: Doing indoor cycling (130bpm) + physio stabilization. Needs short stabilization work after cycling.",
    "Shoulder: Considering Turkish Get-Ups (16kg) for stability."
  ],
  "nutrition_rules": [
    "Protein Powder: Scoop is 30g containing 22g protein (75% concentration).",
    "I use olive oil for salads (assume 1 tbsp if not specified)."
  ],
  "takeaways": [
    "Squat: Progressed from 80-82 volume to 100x4 heavy.",
    "Bench: 90x2 was slow/grindy; needs backoff volume (80-82) to stabilize.",
    "Deadlift: 110x5 was heavy (singles); goal is to make it a continuous set before moving up.",
    "Bench: 80kg volume felt controlled with RPE 8, moving towards RPE 9 on later sets, suggesting good backoff volume for stabilization.",
    "Deadlift volume at 100kg RPE 8 consistent across multiple sets."
